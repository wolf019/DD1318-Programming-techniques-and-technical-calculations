### Learning outcomes
* Programming in a modern programming language. Data structures and classes. Problem solving by division into subproblems.  * Program structuring. Several smaller programming tasks as well as a larger, individual programming task with great
* emphasis on structuring and specification of the included modules.

## Individual programming task

### Handed description  
* The program shall provide guidance on stock purchases. To find out if the stock is worth to buy, either a fundamental 
* analysis can be performed or a technical analysis. A technical analysis looks at the history of the stock. Technical 
* analysis is used from at least when the stock is to be held for a short time. Fundamental analysis is more important when 
* retaining the share for a longer period. The program should also be able to rank shares according to their value. Do not 
* se only the shares that are available, but increase by at least one additional share when you find some interesting data.
* For full description from KTH please see 187-Aktiek√∂p.pdf.

### Extra assignments
* grade C: Applies complete exception handling of the user's input.
* Grade B: The stock data that accompanies this task is only historical interest. Find or create a website with up-to-date 
* stock information and read from it.
* Grade A: Go is a graphical application of different sections (GUI) to the program.

## Acknowledgments

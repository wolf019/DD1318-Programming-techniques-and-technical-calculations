#
#   stock_pick.py v.2
#   DD 1318 @ KTH
#   For P-assignment 2020
#
#   The program needs two folders in the same file as where the program exists.
#   One folder named data_files_in and one work_data_files.
#       - In data_files_in you save csv files from nasdaq just as they are.
#       - In the work_data_files folder the program will save necessary files.
#       - Fundamentals file needs to be updated manualy. This will be automated in v2.
#
#   If you se a variable "days" it is for further development. This verision does just handle time periods of 30 days.
#   Next verisione will give the user the ability to change time period.
#
#   In v.2 I have implementd the feature to add stocks by type in the stock shortening like "tsla" for Tesla inc.
#
#   Please also try out the GUI! -> stock_pick_gui.py
